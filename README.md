<center><h1>Mining the Bitocin Transaction Network</h1></center>

 The Bitcoin transaction network operates with in a decentralized
 system,where transactions are recorded on the blockchain ledger.
 This ecosystem is rich with intricate financial interactions.Our
 study takes a deep dive into understanding this network,focusing
 on key elements like its structure, identifying communities,and
 using spectral clustering,and identifying the most endorsed nodes.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<b>Community Detection:</b>A community is a subset of nodes that are densely connected to each other and loosely connected to the nodes in the other communities in the same graph. W ehave detected communites using different approaches like Louvain Algorithm and Girvan-Neuman Algorithm. Different communities within the Bitcoin graph can signify various aspect of the ecosystem. For exmaple, they may represent differnet types of users or entities, such as miners, investors, or exchanges.

<b>Spectral Clustering:</b> It is a clustering technique that uses eigenvectors of a similarity matrix to partition data points into clusters. Spectral Clustering in the Bitcoin grpah can provide valuable insights into the network's resilience and robustness against attacks or disruptions.

<b>Endorsed Nodes:</b> We can explore how trust propogates through the netwrok by examining which nodes endorse other highly endorsed nodes forming a recursive netwrok of trust relationships.
